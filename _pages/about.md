Being a regular 90s kid, I enjoy playing video games, watching movies and football games, and reading manga. As a lifelong Liverpool supporter, football holds a special place in my heart

Continuing my passion for learning, I am currently studying various data analyst skills like Git, Docker, and API to enhance my expertise in the field. Additionally, I have plans to explore marketing analysis and project management, aiming to acquire essential soft skills, critical thinking, and analysis, which will greatly benefit my career path.

And last but not least, I am a dog person. My first dog, Touyfoo, was named after a Chinese sweet, symbolizing her fluffiness and pink charm. Although she has passed away, her memory lives on as we welcomed our energetic second dog, Muffin, into our family.
