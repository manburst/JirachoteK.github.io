I was born and raised in Nontaburi, Thailand. I have a Master's degree in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology from Chulalongkorn University, and a Bachelor's degree from Mahidol University. Currently, I'm working as a clinical bioinformatics and data analyst. My work involves identifying disease-causing mutations from sequencing data, creating bioinformatics pipelines for data analysis, and analyzing biological data to gain valuable insights.

My skill
======
I have a good understanding of biology, especially animal studies, because I've always loved watching animal documentaries like National Geographic since I was a kid. I stay updated by reading textbooks, journals, and news. I enjoy automating tasks with scripts to work efficiently and save time. I can code in Python, R, Bash, SQL, and HTML. Additionally, I can create informative dashboards using Power BI for monitoring and analysis. In bioinformatics, I'm experienced in data retrieval, sequence analysis, statistical analysis, and using tools like GATK, DESeq, BLAST, and EnrichR.

During my M.Sc. program in Thailand, I developed important soft skills like critical thinking and analysis while doing research and answering questions from advisors and professors. I'm effective in business communication and negotiating deals for lab equipment. Maintaining a positive and growth-oriented mindset is crucial for my well-being. Collaboration is one of my strengths, enabling effective teamwork where we support and help each other. I'm adaptable and thrive in various situations and environments.

My interested
======
I have a diverse range of interests that reflect my love for typical 90s Thai culture. Being a regular 90s kid, I enjoy playing video games, watching movies and football games, and indulging in manga. As a lifelong Liverpool supporter since the age of 10, football holds a special place in my heart, even though my skills on the field might not be impressive. Among my cherished possessions is a vast collection of manga, with Tokyo Ghoul being an all-time favorite.

Continuing my passion for learning, I am currently studying various IT skills like Git, Docker, and API to enhance my expertise in the field. Additionally, I have plans to explore marketing analysis and project management, aiming to acquire essential soft skills, critical thinking, and analysis, which will greatly benefit my career path.

And last but not least, I am undoubtedly a dog person! My first furry companion, Touyfoo, was named after a Chinese sweet, symbolizing her fluffiness and pink charm. Although she has passed away, her memory lives on as we welcomed our energetic second dog, Muffin, into our family.
