I am Jirachote Karunyakorn, a graduate of Chulalongkorn University with a Master's degree in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. Now I am working as Clinical bioinformatics and analyst.

My skill
======
Ever since I was a child, I have been fascinated by biology. Therefore, I chose to pursue a degree in biology at Mahidol University, where I graduated with first-class honors. As a result, I possess a considerable level of expertise in this field, particularly in animal studies.

During my senior year of undergraduate studies, I began my foray into programming with R, primarily due to the abundance of bioinformatics packages available for it. This experience sparked my love for programming, leading me to decide to further pursue the study of programming alongside biology. Hence, I opted for bioinformatics as my specialization. Throughout my journey, I have acquired knowledge in Python, R, SQL, bash, and HTML.

My interested
======
As mentioned earlier, I have a deep fascination for Biology. To continuously expand my knowledge, I regularly read biology textbooks and research papers.I also work as a freelance high school biology tutor. Not only does this provide me with additional income, but it also serves as a means to assess my understanding of the subject matter.

Over the past three years, I have dedicated a significant amount of time to practicing coding, honing my analytical skills, and fostering critical thinking abilities. I believe that these skills will prove essential in the near future, as AI becomes increasingly accessible, comparable to widely-used tools like Google. I always remind myself that "if we to be come the pilot, we must surpass the co-pilots."

During my free time, I enjoy playing video games. I own a PS5 and a Nintendo Switch; however, since graduating and entering the workforce, I have had limited time to indulge in gaming, resulting in several games remaining unplayed.
