**Analysis of top 100 transfer fee in past 50 years**

In this comprehensive analysis, we delve into transfer data extracted from the Transfermarkt website, spanning from the 1973/1974 season to the present, encompassing the 2023/2024 season.

Motivation:Over the past 15 years, transfer fees have skyrocketed due to various factors, such as business-minded individuals investing in football clubs. Entrepreneurs have taken a keen interest in the football club business, leading to club acquisitions. Prominent examples include Manchester City, PSG, and more recently, Newcastle, which was bought by an Arabian billionaire. Given this context, our analysis aims to uncover insights from the top 100 transfers across the last 50 seasons, spanning from 1973 to 2024. While our data covers transfers from all over the world, We're mainly looking at transfers that happened in Europe and South America, not because we chose to, but because the top 100 transfers have mostly happened in these places. Limiting our scope to the top 100 transfers is a practical choice due to the challenges of collecting comprehensive data due to its sheer volume and privacy considerations. Our main goals include understanding how transfer fees have grown, identifying dominant player positions, as well as examining the roles of nationality and league affiliations. We're also looking into whether various factors like a player's age, statistics from the season before the transfer (like appearances, goals, and assists), or their nationality influence transfer fees. Additionally, we'll explore how external events like the establishment of the Premier League, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the occurrence of World Cup tournaments might have affected transfer trends and fee structures.

By digging into this extensive dataset and putting it into the context of historical events, we aim to get a full picture of how transfer fees have evolved and the different factors that play a role in shaping this ever-changing landscape.
