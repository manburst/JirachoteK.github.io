**Analysis of top 100 transfer fee in past 50 years**

In this comprehensive analysis, we delve into transfer data extracted from the Transfermarkt website, spanning from the 1973/1974 season to the present, encompassing the 2023/2024 season.

Motivation:Over the past 15 years, transfer fees have skyrocketed due to various factors, such as business-minded individuals investing in football clubs. Entrepreneurs have taken a keen interest in the football club business, leading to club acquisitions. Prominent examples include Manchester City, PSG, and more recently, Newcastle, which was bought by an Arabian billionaire. Given this context, our analysis aims to uncover insights from the top 100 transfers across the last 50 seasons, spanning from 1973 to 2024. While our data covers transfers from all over the world, We're mainly looking at transfers that happened in Europe and South America, not because we chose to, but because the top 100 transfers have mostly happened in these places. Limiting our scope to the top 100 transfers is a practical choice due to the challenges of collecting comprehensive data due to its sheer volume and privacy considerations. Our main goals include understanding how transfer fees have grown, identifying dominant player positions, as well as examining the roles of nationality and league affiliations. We're also looking into whether various factors like a player's age, statistics from the season before the transfer (like appearances, goals, and assists), or their nationality influence transfer fees. Additionally, we'll explore how external events like the establishment of the Premier League, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the occurrence of World Cup tournaments might have affected transfer trends and fee structures.

By digging into this extensive dataset and putting it into the context of historical events, we aim to get a full picture of how transfer fees have evolved and the different factors that play a role in shaping this ever-changing landscape.

Part 1: Collecting the data by web scraping with beautiful soup


For the data collection process, I utilized the power of Beautiful Soup 4 to scrape information from the top transfers in each season. Fortunately, these transfers were neatly organized in tables, with each page accommodating 25 players—making the scraping process relatively straightforward. However, this simplicity presented a potential complication down the line. To ensure accurate data extraction, I recommend employing the 'find all' tag. This approach guarantees the comprehensive retrieval of data.


Additionally, we undertook the task of amassing player statistics from the season prior to their transfers, encompassing metrics such as appearances, goals, and assists. An essential lesson emerged from this endeavor: the extraction process had the potential to become time-intensive, as the code navigates through each page and accesses player profiles to retrieve their pre-transfer season statistics. This prolonged runtime could potentially lead to connection errors. To circumvent this, I suggest implementing a random time delay ranging from 1 to 3 seconds for every player and page accessed. This strategy can mitigate connection disruptions and facilitate smoother data collection.


Upon obtaining the results, the subsequent step involved selecting the top 100 transfers and amalgamating the data from various seasons, neatly consolidating it into a single file for further analysis.

**Part 2 Data cleaning**

With Great data come with great responsibility (to cleaning) Uncle Ben as Data analyst said


Upon completing the scraping process, a glaring challenge became evident—the data was far from tidy!:

1.Player Name and Position Fusion: The player's name and their respective position were muddled together within a single column.
2.Club and League Conflation: The club and league information were intertwined in the same column, while the club's nationality was curiously absent.
3.Empty 'Nat' Column: Curiously, the 'Nat' (Nationality) column contained null entries. Thankfully, a silver lining existed: separate nationality data had been collected independently, obviating the need for an additional scraping endeavor.

Here's the roadmap for cleaning the data:


1.Data Separation: Divide the merged player name and position into distinct columns.
2.Fee Standardization: Convert transfer fees into numeric format. Additionally, transform fee values from thousands (K) to millions (M) for consistency.
3.Season Format Transformation: Convert abbreviated season entries (e.g., 92/93) into a more comprehensible full format (e.g., 1992/1993). This modification is crucial to ensure accurate sorting.
4.Incorporating League Nationality: Append the corresponding league nationality to enhance the contextual understanding of club data.
5.Null Data and Loan Player Removal: Eliminate rows with null data and those related to loaned players, streamlining the dataset.
By undertaking these steps, we'll successfully navigate the complexities of the messy data, transforming it into a more structured and usable format for subsequent analysis.

The average age of transfers settles at 24, reflecting the prevalent trend of football clubs seeking to secure young and promising talent to reinforce their squads. This propensity for recruiting younger players is driven by the desire to mold and develop potential future stars.

However, a remarkable outlier emerges with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's transfer from LA Galaxy to AC Milan at the age of 37. This transfer stands out as an exception to the youth-focused pattern, showcasing the enduring impact of seasoned players who continue to make significant contributions even in the latter stages of their careers.

Another notable player that contributes to the unique range of ages in football transfers is Kazuyoshi Miura, affectionately known as "King Kazu." As the oldest active football player in the world, Miura has defied age expectations by continuing to compete professionally well into his 50s. His remarkable journey showcases not only his enduring passion for the sport but also challenges conventional notions of player longevity in the football realm.

In contrast, the minimum age observed in these football transfers is 16, underscoring the diverse range of player ages involved. This renewed emphasis on youth aligns with modern football trends, where emerging talents hold a stronger sway than in earlier times. Jude Bellingham's move from Birmingham to Dortmund at the age of 16 exemplifies this shift, reflecting football's evolving stance on nurturing young prospects for a brighter future.


This inclination toward younger players isn't accidental; rather, it's a strategic response to the evolving demands of the sport. Clubs increasingly invest in youth, even if these players might not be ready for immediate first-team action. Several crucial reasons drive this strategy. Firstly, it's an investment in the long run, grooming talents within the club's system to align with its values. Secondly, it's financially prudent, as young prospects come at lower fees, allowing for resource sustainability. Thirdly, young talents carry immense potential, developing rapidly and eventually contributing significantly. Additionally, it reinforces the club's identity, resonating with local fans. Lastly, young players enrich squad competition and depth, even if not starting. In sum, this investment acknowledges the future-shaping value of nurturing young talents.

Jude Bellingham has made his transfer at age only 16

The mean transfer fee of 10 million euros illustrates the central range of fees, with a substantial standard deviation around 14.58684 highlighting the wide distribution from this average. This variation results from various key factors: larger clubs with more financial resources tend to engage in higher fee transfers, highly talented players command elevated fees, market dynamics and demand contribute to fee fluctuations, players with potential garner substantial fees, and clubs aiming for immediate success are willing to invest more. Simultaneously, the record-breaking transfer fee. The record-breaking fee for Neymar's move from Barcelona to PSG at 222 million euros results from his stature, market conditions, and PSG's strategic goals, demonstrating the convergence of player excellence, market trends, and club aspirations.

First let see the overall transfer growth

![image](https://github.com/manburst/JirachoteK.github.io/assets/68594551/4eb85191-c745-4e74-a0c0-84533654c576)

Let's see the overall transfer growth. At the outset, transfer fees appeared relatively stable, 1974 and 1978 World Cups likely contributed to the increased attention on the sport, with transfer fees rising in the immediate aftermath of these tournaments, gradually escalating around 1986 due to World Cups in Spain (1982) and Mexico (1986), where increased investment in South American talents and new interest in football worldwide might have spurred growth. A significant turning point arrived with the establishment of the Premier League which the increasing television rights and sponsorship deals have led to more money flowing into the game in 1992 and the rising impact of UEFA Champions League during the 1990s further accelerated this growth. This era also saw significant increases following the 1990 World Cup in Italy and the 1994 World Cup in the USA, reflecting the globalization and booming football industry, leading to an infusion of capital that triggered exponential growth.  The 2001/2002 season marks a pinnacle, highlighted by Zidane's transfer from Juventus to Real Madrid for a record-breaking 77 million euros. Notably, Gianluigi Buffon's move from Parma to Juventus also sets a record for goalkeeper fees, standing at around 50 million euros. The 21st century began with a continuation of rapid growth, but the average transfer fees were affected by global events like the dot-com bubble and the collapse of ITV Digital in the UK, which likely overshadowed the impact of the 2002 World Cup. Recovery was noted in the mid-2000s, coinciding with the successful 2006 World Cup in Germany. Following this peak, transfer fees experience a dip but subsequently show a rising trend that eventually surpasses the 2001 peak. The global financial crisis of 2007-2009 slowed down the growth, but the steady rise resumed through the 2010s. The influence of World Cups during this period, such as those held in South Africa (2010), Brazil (2014), and Russia (2018), became more inconsistent, possibly reflecting the multifaceted nature of football's economy and other dominant factors. This resurgence includes remarkable transfers like Gareth Bale's and Neymar's. Notably, the COVID-19 pandemic in the 2020/2021 and 2021/2022 seasons results in a significant fee reduction due to football clubs losing income from ticket sales and merchandise.The COVID-19 pandemic marked a significant decrease in transfer fees during 2019/2020-2020/2021, impacting clubs' spending due to lost revenues. A subsequent recovery was observed, with an increase following the unique winter World Cup in Qatar in 2022 (Add player who move after WC2022). Nevertheless, financially robust clubs such as Manchester City, Chelsea, and PSG continue to make acquisitions. The 2022/2023 season sees geopolitical events affecting football, as Russia's conflict with Ukraine leads to Roman Abramovich's Chelsea ownership being frozen. The club is eventually sold to American businessman Todd Boly, who infuses substantial investment and triggers a significant spending spree of nearly 600 million euros on new players. Even I use sugar daddy cheat in FM game not like that!.  

Throughout this timeline, the dynamics of the football transfer market intertwine with various events, from league formations and wars to owner changes. These factors collectively shape the trajectory of transfer fees, underscoring the sport's ever-evolving nature. The average transfer fee data across this period reveals a complex interplay between global football events, particularly World Cups, and the broader economic landscape. Early World Cups notably elevated transfer fees, while the influence of inflation has contributed to the overall escalation, highlighting the intricate connection between football's economic dynamics and global financial trends. Additionally, league formations, club ambitions, and geopolitical events have significantly molded the transfer landscape, underscoring how transfer fees are shaped by interconnected variables within football's evolving economic ecosystem.

The introduction of market value in 2002/2003 aimed to assess a player's worth based on performance, age, and nationality. While market value and transfer fee are closely related, it's evident that actual fees often surpass estimated values. This discrepancy is highlighted by a robust correlation, with a coefficient of determination (R) at 0.95.

The maximum transfer value also follows the average trend. A remarkable surge occurred in 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 when PSG's acquisition of Neymar significantly raised the bar. However, as five years have elapsed, it appears unlikely for such heights to be attained again. Even for players like Mbappe, whose contract is down to one year, it's improbable that Real Madrid would invest more than 200 million euros in his acquisition.
