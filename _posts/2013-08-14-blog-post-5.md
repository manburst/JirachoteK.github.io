Get data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/residentmario/iowa-liquor-sales

This time, we will analyze data using SQL and DAX on Power BI Desktop.
We will use a database browser for ease in creating the database. First, we need to create a new database before importing the CSV data as a table into the database.

And there you go

From count(*), we have a total of 12,591,077 rows, which is a lot of data. The file size is approximately 1.5 GB, which is too large and might cause a memory crash. Therefore, we will add a 'year' column to know how many entries are there for each year.

To find out the data for each year, we execute the following SQL query:


![image](https://github.com/manburst/JirachoteK.github.io/assets/68594551/58907392-5835-4cfd-85ad-f28b179d59e2)


The result shows data between 2012 and 2017.


We will extract the data for the years 2014 to 2016 (as 2017 is not complete) using the following query:

After verifying data consistency, we select DISTINCT ZipCode from Iowa_Liquor_Sales and order it by ZipCode in descending order. We found the zipcode '712-2,' which needs to be corrected.

We spot some null values in SQL.

Due to limitations in SQL, we will further clean the data, such as removing null data, in Power Query in Power BI. The selected columns for data analysis will be: 'Invoice/ItemNumber', 'Date', 'StoreName', 'City', 'ZipCode', 'County', 'CategoryName', 'VendorName', 'ItemDescription', 'Pack', 'StateBottleCost', 'StateBottleRetail', 'BottlesSold', 'Sale(Dollars)', 'VolumeSold(Liters)'.

The conditions we will use are a year between 2014 and 2016, as mentioned, and Category is not null.

Due to special characters like slash '/' and parentheses '()' in column names, it could cause a query error, so we must double-quote them.

After exporting the CSV file, we are now ready to import the query and perform some minor cleaning in Power Query in Power BI.

After importing the file into Power BI, we perform a fill-down to replace null values in the 'County', 'City', and 'ZipCode' columns due to some missing entries for various reasons. However, we can fix this issue because some rows have the same store name with complete information in the address columns. The problem we encountered is a memory crash or extremely slow fill-down. My Power BI version is from August 2023, which also crashes with a large amount of data in previous versions. (Update: I have reinstalled it due to the problem 'Microsoft.PowerBI.OleDb' is not registered.) So, we need to switch back to Python.

In this code, we will replace blanks with null and then group by 'StoreName' to forward and backward fill the rows.

And now, the file is likely finally prepared for analysis.

We then start to add column of

Total Revenue = iowa_2014_2016_fill[StateBottleRetail]*iowa_2014_2016_fill[BottlesSold]
Total Cost = iowa_2014_2016_fill[StateBottleCost]*iowa_2014_2016_fill[BottlesSold]
Total Order = COUNTROWS('iowa_2014_2016_fill')
Total Profit = iowa_2014_2016_fill[Total Revenue]-iowa_2014_2016_fill[Total Cost]
count_unique_store = DISTINCTCOUNT('iowa_2014_2016_fill'[StoreName])


The goal for this dashboard is to investigate the sales data from the last three years.

The main objective is to investigate the sales data from the last three years by monitoring:


1.	How orders, costs, revenue, profit, and store count have changed over the years.
2.	The trend of liquor sales by day of the week.
3.	The market share of cities.
4.	The market share of categories.
5.	The trend of revenue over the years.


Create a date dimension from the first day to the last day of our data.

The date dimension is not automatically linked to our data, so we have to drag and drop to create the link of the relationship.




First, we create measures for Year over Year revenue, profit, cost, count of orders (which are rows), and count of unique store names, with a direction to compare the previous year. We then adjust the format and return to show the desired value.

Note that we can adjust 'Year over Year' to 'Month over Month' or 'Quarter over Quarter' by replacing 'year' with 'month' or 'quarter'.

And use color as conditional matting on field rule

For count of unique store we use function distinct count

And for order use count row for count all transaction

And note that direction of the cost will be reversed (the lower the better

Here is what the card visualization looks like. It will display the direction, the short measure result, and the percent change when we filter by year.

For the slicer just remove other date hierarchy except year

For the line graph representing the time series by month, we've incorporated a clever approach. We've added data labels indicating the direction when comparing month over month, along with the sum of revenue for the current month. This was achieved by adjusting the previous formula.

![image](https://github.com/manburst/JirachoteK.github.io/assets/68594551/c229207b-dbcf-4965-a604-59034a4960c6)

Add the measure to customize the data label, and don't forget to apply conditional formatting to change the color. The result will look like this.

Pro tip: When creating a pie plot, using correlated colors with a gradient, like a heatmap, can make it easier to distinguish and monitor the dashboard. You can choose palettes from coolors.com.

You also can adjust the data label to show only percent for precise information.

For day of week we sort total revenue from descending and format the gradient

The final result of our dashboard is in. What's peculiar is the absence of 'Sunday' during the week, and a significant downturn in the last four months of 2016. The cause for this is unknown. Additionally, the first year lacks previous year data, thus showing no change, as does the first month. However, in subsequent months, even in January 2015, there is a reference to changes from December 2014.

It's important to note that this data is sourced from a third party, and it may not be complete. We've cleaned the data as much as possible without introducing bias.

Lastly, a common mistake among new Power BI users is inadequate preparation. While Power BI is an easily visualized software, without well-prepared data, it can lead to issues in the results.

Here is a list of mistakes I have made myself:


1.	Data Modeling: If the data model is incorrect, everything else will be incorrect. It's crucial to check the relationships first when importing or creating new tables. Avoid creating a new model during visualization, as it can lead to errors.
2.	Dirty Data: As mentioned, it's essential to check the data for null values, correct format types, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies. These four aspects can pose significant challenges for data analysts. The choice of software for data cleaning may vary based on user skill. Personally, I find Python to be the most effective. If dealing with streaming data, SQL may be necessary for cleaning, which can be a bit challenging. Power BI now offers the ability to connect to a Python interpreter for direct data cleaning, although it might not be entirely stable yet.
3.	DAX Syntax: DAX syntax is easy to learn but challenging to master, much like Excel. If you aim to create more complex visualizations, mastering DAX is a necessity.
4.	Deception by Color: The automatic color selection in Power BI is often inadequate. It's important to manually adjust colors to accurately represent information to the user.
5.	Date Hierarchy: In one plot, you can contain more than one hierarchy. However, if the data is not well-structured, with mixed format types or missing data, it can cause trouble such as displaying wrong information or introducing bias.
